## Installations
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

For a seamless experience, it is recommended that you install Python through the Anaconda distribution as per:

## Project Motivation
Growing up in Austin and moving away after high school, it is truly amazing to see the changes around the city when I go back home. 
My parents still live in Austin and when we talk, I often hear about all the  new things. What new restaurant has come to the city, 
popular areas, and parts that have changed from what I remember. Most of the changes I hear about are related to the housing market.
I see these changes when it is time to make a trip back home and I am looking at AirBNB for places to stay for me and my growing family. 
The ranges on the nightly rates have always been so wide and I always wondered what renters factor in when listing their property and 
if I had a property, what would I list it for. Taking this class presented me with the perfect opportunity to see if there is some 
insight I can find in what hosts on AirBnB list their properties for and why. The questions I sought out to answer are:


- If you were looking for a sound investment property to rent on Airbnb in Austin, where should you look?
- Which neighborhoods have the highest average price to rent?
- Which neighborhoods have the most hosts?
- What room type rents for the most?

### File Descriptions
From  AirBnB, I downloaded the Detailed Listings data for Austin from the last four time points available (March 200, December 2021, September 2021, and June 2021). 
These four files are available as CSV files and the link for the data dictionary is below. 

There is a Jupyter Notebook available that contains my work related to answering the questions above. The notebook contains the steps in the data wrangling process
(gathering, assessing, cleaning), creating some data visualizations, and building and evaluating a model. Markdown cells were used to distinguish different parts of
the process.

### 4. How to Interact with the project
Feel free to take a look at the work I've done and see if you can expand on it. Hopefully my works makes you think of some other ways to view this data
or other questions to ask.
